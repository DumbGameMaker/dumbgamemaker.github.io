# Opaldotjs

Hi! I'm Syrx, a human. I go by They/She pronouns

I mostly program in ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-yellow?style=rounded-square&logo=javascript&logoColor=white) using ![Nodejs](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Nodejs-green?style=rounded-square&logo=Node.js&logoColor=white), but I am also working with ![Swift](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Swift-black?style=rounded-square&logo=swift).

## Dev Challenge Bot Submissions

### formats: 

These dictate the structure of the challenge.
An example is `A $softwares, using $technology, $twists`
Where softwares is 'content management system', technology is 'C99', and twists is 'using only one variable',
The result is 'a content management system using C99 with only one variable'.

Available placeholders are:
Softwares
Technology
Twists
Criticals (func, vars, etc.)
Problems (fizzbuzz etc)

If your idea also needs a new placeholder, submit that too in the next section.

The form below if it even shows isnt working right now 

<form onSubmit="https://add-to.her.pi.cluster.ws">
